# I am on the 2021 job market!

[Curriculum Vitae](files/DanielleGonzalez_Nov2020_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}

My name is **Danielle Gonzalez**; I am a PhD candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, NY. I am currently funded by a [Microsoft PhD Fellowship](https://www.rit.edu/news/graduate-student-receives-prestigious-microsoft-fellowship), awarded in 2019.
## Research Interests
Using **mixed empirical software engineering research** methods, I aim to **produce supportive, actionable resources and insights for developers and teams driven by observation of real practices and investigations into the sociotechnical factors** that affect each lifecycle phase. 

I am particularly interested in:
 - Software (Unit & Integration) Testing 
 - Secure Software Design, Development, & Testing
 - Vulnerability Management
 - Human Factors in SE / Behavioral SE
 - Mining Software Repositories

To study development practices, I build **automated tools to mine and analyze artifacts from software repositories** and use **inductive analysis techniques** to systematically develop theories and synthesize data into forms usable by developers. Further, I conduct **interviews and human subject evaluations** to understand developer's perspectives as well as validate the usefulness and accuracy of my research outcomes.
