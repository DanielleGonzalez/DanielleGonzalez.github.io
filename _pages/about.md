# Danielle Gonzalez

## Affiliation
I am a 5th year PhD student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, NY and was selected as a [Microsoft PhD Fellow](https://www.rit.edu/news/graduate-student-receives-prestigious-microsoft-fellowship) in 2019.

My advisor is [Dr. Mehdi Mirakhorli](https://www.se.rit.edu/~mehdi/), who runs the [Software Design and Productivity Lab](https://design.se.rit.edu). This lab is also affiliated with RIT's [Global Cybersecurity Institute](https://www.rit.edu/cybersecurity/) and the [Department of Software Engineering](se.rit.edu).

## Publications

## Research Interests

I conduct empirical studies to understand the current practices for phenomena related to the following topics:
 - Software (Unit & Integration) Testing 
 - Secure Software Development
 - Vulnerability Management
 - Human Factors in SE / Behavioral SE
 - Mining Software Repositories

### Dissertation
 The topic of my PhD dissertation is **security unit testing**, *i.e.* the use of unit testing to evaluate behaviors of web application security controls such as authentication, authorization, and session manangement. 

 Specifically, I aim to
 - Understand the motivations, perspectives, and challenges which influence developer's decision to write such tests
 - Promote adoption of this technique by developing resources and tools to address such challenges and de-motivators

For example, few security testing guidelines discuss or promote security unit testing. Those which do, however, fail to present suggested test cases in a context that is easy for developers to translate into a unit test.  This motivated a recent study ([Did You Remember to Test Your Tokens?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3379597.3387471)) where we identified *how* developers currently test authentication through a grounded theory analysis of 481 JUnit tests. The outcome of this study was a developer-friendly token authentication unit testing guide organized as a catalog of 53 test cases, presented in a format that is easy to convert from natural language to a unit test.
